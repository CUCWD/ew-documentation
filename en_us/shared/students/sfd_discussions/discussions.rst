Course discussions give you the opportunity to start conversations with other
students, ask questions that other students or the course team can answer, and
participate in the course community. If you have not previously participated in
an online discussion forum, see the introductory :ref:`Anatomy of EducateWorkforce Course
Discussions` section.

This chapter also describes features of EducateWorkforce discussions that can make your
participation more effective:
