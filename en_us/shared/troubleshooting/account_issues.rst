Here are some typical issues that a user could be dealing with when trying to activate their account
on EducateWorkforce.

.. _SFD Activation:

***************************************************************
Activation
***************************************************************

After creating your EducateWorkforce account an activation email will be sent to the registered email address.

.. note::
   You will be able to continue to utilize EducateWorkforce during the first browser session after account activation.
   Additional attempts to login will only be available if the activation link is clicked to verify the account.

   If an account is not activated and a user attempts to authenticate from the **Login** page another activation email
   will be generated to allow them to verify the account.  Please try these actions before requesting help from
   `support@educateworkforce.com`_.

Here is a sample activation email.

.. _SFD Account Exists:

***************************************************************
Account Exists
***************************************************************

The error message displays from the **Sign Up** page when credentials entered match an existing account.  Correct this
by entering in alternative required fields (specifically *Email* field).

.. note::
   Alternatively you could try the :ref:`Password Reset<SFD Password Reset>` procedure to gain access to existing account
   instead of registering a new account.
